When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When working on a project together with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    To know what changes you are pulling, especially of others are working on
    the same project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are copies of another (somebody else's) repository on GitHub. Clones
    are copies of repositories locally. Branches are copies of repositories
    that do not affect the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Makes merges easier.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Share files. No need to learn git, but tracking changes would be a mess...

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
