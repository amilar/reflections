What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The repository is created in a hidden folder, but no commit is made. In order
to include files in the repository, the first commit has to be made manually.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area sits between the working directory and respository, and
includes files that will be committed to the reporsitory at some point. The
working directory is the directory in which the repository is located, but can
include both files that are in the repository, and filesthat are not.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

Use git diff to verify what the differences are between working directory,
staging area, and repository.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized? How would branches help?

When testing out new features, without wanting to change the main branch of
the project yet. Making a separate branch allows changes to be tested out,
while the main branch can still be updated if needed.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
